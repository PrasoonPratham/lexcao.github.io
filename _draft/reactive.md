# Reactive Streams

Reactive Streams started as an initiative in late 2013 between engineers at [*Netflix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix), [*Pivotal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software) and [*Lightbend*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbend).

> Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide **a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure**. This encompasses efforts aimed at runtime environments (JVM and JavaScript) as well as network protocols.

You can read the full details on official website of [*Reactive Streams*](https://www.reactive-streams.org/).

Also, you can read the Chinese translation from [*here*](https://lexcao.github.io/zh/posts/reactive-streams).

Here, I will cover some implementations of Reactive Streams on JVM platform, and then I am going to dive into more about them in the next post. 



# In other words

**asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure**

So,  the Reactive Streams is divided as flowing:

1. asynchoronous
2. stream 
3. non-blocking
4. back pressure

# Project Reactor

> Reactor is a fourth-generation Reactive library for building non-blocking applications on the JVM based on the [Reactive Streams Specification](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm)



# Spring Reactor

# RxJava

# RSocket
